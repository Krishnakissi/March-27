Test
1) Explain java and javac 
java command helps to run the program

javac 

java "c" means java compilation where compiler converts the source code to bite code 

2) explain JDK,JRE,JVM
JDK:- java development kit
    JDK is the combination of JRE and JVM 
	it contains set of libraies
	
JRE:- java run time environment
   *it is used to excute the code
   * it is combination of JDK and development tools
   
JVM:- java virtual machine 
	* 

3)List the limitation of an array
	array is list of data
	we can store n number of data or values in a array list
	we should store only same type of data in an array list
	example:- if we are storing a String type of data we use String array where we should enter only name
				if we try to store int type of data type in String array we get error


4)Explain class,object and signature of the class
	it has some state and bheaviours
Class is key word in java,it a blue print of an object.

Object is the instance of a class 
it is used to create copies of class by using the keyword call "new".
when an object is created it occupies some storage

5)Differnce between the .java and .class flie
.java is a source file where as .class is an byte code

6)Explain the method signature 
method is a block of code which performs some specific funtionality of an class

	method signature :-public void main(){
										}
 here public is called as acces specifier ,void is the return type ,main is the method name,()paranthises followed by "{}"

7) What is java
*java is a object oriented program 
* java is mainly used to build application like mobile application,E-commerce ,banking application etc
* java can run in any platform so it is called as platform independent 
* java is easy to understand 


8) List the java IDE's
  java IDE's means java application to write the program
  * Eclipse
  *intellij IDEA
  *Notepad++ 
  
9)What is variables explain its type
variables are the containers which is used to store the data 
its types are 
*Static variables - declared  inside the class outside the main method 
*local variables - declared inside the class and within the main method
*instance variables - declared outside the main method without using Static keyword
*parameterised variables

10)List 15 keywords
*byte,int,float,double,char,short,long,boolean,super,this,if,new,Extend,import,public,private,procted

11) What is a class variables!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

12) What is data type and its type
datatype is the type of data stored in a variables
there are two types Primitive and Non primitive 
Primitive are 8 and Non Primitive means n number that is user defined they are class names ,String Array etc

13) What is dot operator
it is used to access the members and properties from other class 

14)List the features of java
object oriented
platform independent runs in all platforms
multi threaded

15)What is the base class of all the classes 111!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

16) What is Method overloading with an example
 Method overloading means a two methods having same Method name but different in parameters
 
 example:- public void test(int){
	 System.out.Println("calling test method")
 }

		public void test(String){
	 System.out.Println("calling test method")
 }
